# About Me

Hi, My Name is Prateek Sunal and I am a Flutter Developer.

I am also a student contributor at GSoC'23 and this website will be used to serve blogs related to my journey and what I have accomplished in this.

I will also share my experiences and what I have been working on lately in this website.

Stay tune cause I will upload the blogs in September month so you all can also know my experience.

Till then you can view my project:
[SUBillManager](/subillmanager) - Manage electricity bill like no before.
